# Concatenate pairs of sound files with pause according to file names in tab-separated text file
# 
# For each pair of sound files, file names must be listed in order 
# in 1st 2 columns (minus '.wav'), with 3rd column as name for final concatenated file
# **Table must have header row, although names are irrelevant**
#
# ***Make sure you don't have any spaces in your file paths***
# (i.e. don't use folders with spaces in the name, and make sure there are no extra spaces at the end)
#
# Useful for AX experiments
